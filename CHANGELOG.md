# Changelog

## Un-released changes

This should be backwards compatible for everyone, but given that the types have changed, I'm making it a new major version just in case

- Feature: `createContextHelper` (#3)
- Types: Update return type of `wrap()`, it should play nicely with `@testing-library/react@13` now (#4)
- Types: Export internal types in case people want to use them for extensions etc (#2)
- Docs: All sorts of misc improvements to docs & comments (#5, #6)
- Chore: Lots of dependency upgrades and other internal fixes
