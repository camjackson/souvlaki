# Changelog

## Un-released changes

This should be backwards compatible for everyone, but given that the types have changed, I'm making it a new major version just in case

- Feature: `createContextHelper` ([#3](https://github.com/camjackson/souvlaki/issues/3))
- Types: Update return type of `wrap()`, it should play nicely with `@testing-library/react@13` now ([#4](https://github.com/camjackson/souvlaki/issues/4))
- Types: Export internal types in case people want to use them for extensions etc ([#2](https://github.com/camjackson/souvlaki/issues/2))
- Docs: All sorts of misc improvements to docs & comments ([#5](https://github.com/camjackson/souvlaki/issues/5), [#6](https://github.com/camjackson/souvlaki/issues/6))
- Chore: Lots of dependency upgrades and other internal fixes
