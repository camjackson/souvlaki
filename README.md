# ðŸŒ¯ `souvlaki` ðŸŒ¯

Composable React.js test wrappers, making it easy to test context-heavy components.

- [Core library docs](packages/souvlaki)
- [Apollo docs](packages/souvlaki-apollo)
- [React router docs](packages/souvlaki-react-router)

Note: Don't be discouraged by the fact that the library has not been updated in a couple of years.
It is still very much in active daily use by the author. The library is more or less "finished"
so it doesn't get regular updates any more, but it should still be considered maintained.
